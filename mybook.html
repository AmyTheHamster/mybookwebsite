        <h2>A Day Of Fluffy Squeaks</h2>
        <p>Somewhere just below the ground was a hamster neighborhood: an intricate network of tunnels filled with all sorts of twists and turns. Everyone here lived a great life. But at the end of this normal-looking tunnel was a hamster cafe called "Hazelnut's Coffee Corner." The owner, Hazelnut, was busy brewing the last of her apple lattes, just as she poured them into the coffee dispenser, the sweet aroma of apples and coffee filled the air. When she had just finished placing the sweet cake pops and delicious frosted donuts, in came Mochi, with her fluffy white fur and sparkling brown eyes, she was always first to arrive. Excitedly, she squeaked: "Hey Hazelnut, what yummies are on the menu today?"
            Mochi was best friends with Hazelnut so she came here three times a week and was always Hazelnut's favorite customer. She got a seat and ordered an apple latte and the cafe's special "Nutty Blend" cake pop. Mochi took a sip of her apple latte, the flavor of apple and milk danced in her mouth, the creaminess couldn't be described in words, it felt like the best coffee you could ever have. The cake pop was even better. When Mochi first bit into it, she tasted a blend of peanuts and almonds. After a few seconds, the taste of pistachios and cashews began to spread in her mouth. Moments later, she swallowed it but she could still taste a hint of hazelnut in her mouth.
            While Mochi ate, she began to chat with Hazelnut. Hazelnut suddenly felt a splash of memories coming at her, she remembered the day Mochi first came, she was still a baby, laughing when Hazelnut tickled her, munching loudly while her parents fed her the first donut of her life. "Do you remember the first time you came here?" asked Hazelnut. Mochi quickly replied: "Of course I remember! That peanut donut was so good, I can't stop ordering them!" Just when Mochi finished her sentence, Sesame came in. 
           With his furry gray coat and tiny pink paws, Sesame is and will always be Mochi's little brother. He was also a fan of "Hazelnut's Coffee Corner." Sesame usually is later than Mochi because he always needs that extra little nap. Sesame always grabs a wildflower honey cake pop no matter where he's going. He loves the extremely sweet but not too overwhelming taste of wildflower honey.
            Mochi waved goodbye to Hazelnut and took Sesame to the "Hammy Playground. " She watched Sesame grab a stick with his tiny paws, jump from stick to stick, hop onto the tallest stick, do a handstand followed by a backflip, and make a perfect landing on the thousand-year-old tree trunk. "WOW!" squealed Mochi. She never knew Sesame could do something like that. But little did she know, Sesame had been tip-toeing out of the house and practicing those moves at night. Next, Sesame cartwheeled off the tree trunk and did something more impressive: he rolled into the sand pit and dug as fast as possible. Moments later, Sesame was at the very bottom of the sand pit, he then did some hammy-dancing(the most popular type of dancing among young hamsters), which made Mochi wow again.
            While Mochi admired Sesame's playful antics, Lavender walked into "Hazelnut's Coffee Corner. Lavender didn't come very often, only once a week for an extra energy boost. Today, she felt like drinking a caramel cappuccino on the way to her dancing lesson, she always saw it on the menu, and today she wanted to try something new. Lavender ordered a caramel cappuccino and took a seat. Soon, her drink was ready, she took a sip and found out that this was going to be the best thing she had in her life. It was a perfect blend of caramel and coffee, it went into her mouth silky smooth, even though it was very hot, but it was also very tasty. In fact, it was so good that Lavender didn't want to swallow it!
            Just when she was enjoying her drink, she glanced at her watch. "I'M GOING TO BE LATE!" yelled Lavender. She only had one minute to get there before she was late. She ran as fast as she could, and even though she was the last to get there, she wasn't late, so the teacher didn't say anything. It turned out everyone had brought a drink, so the teacher took everyone's drinks, put them in another room, and gave them water instead. 
           After the teacher took the drinks, the class started. "Point your toes, cross your legs. Lift your head, Clover! Lift your legs, jump, twirl. Perfect!" The teacher continued to tell everyone to do different moves. The last move was a duo move. Lavender did it with Clover. The "best student" , Rose, did it with the teacher. Lavender rested her hands on Clover's shoulders, she jumped as high as she could to form a handstand and proceeded to do all sorts of moves on Clover's shoulders. As soon as Clover felt Lavender doing a handstand on her, she did all kinds of twists and turns with Lavender on her shoulders. 
           Finally, it was break time, in these short five minutes, Lavender managed to finish her drink. Lavender and Clover both thought the dance moves were a bit boring, so they made up their own versions of the moves. They jumped at the same time, did a backflip while holding hands, and lifted their legs to form a giant heart; they also used their hands to form the bottom part of the heart. Then, something unexpected happened, Rose jumped up from her seat and flipped into the heart, grabbed a bunch of red and purple confetti from under her tutu, and gracefully threw it into the air. The three clapped hands like everything was planned and they just did it perfectly. Everything was covered in confetti, and they could hear the teacher's footsteps from the other room. Lavender grabbed a broom and started sweeping up the mess, Clover and Rose were fighting over who was in charge of pouring the confetti into the trash can. Finally, they decided to use "Rock, Paper, Scissors", in the end, Clover got to pour the confetti. And they finished just in time when the teacher came, each one of them pretending to mind their own business. They kept doing moves, until..."Ding dong!" The teacher said: "You three keep dancing, I'm going to go get something." Moments later, the teacher returned with a small bag. Everyone wanted to see what was inside but the teacher said it was a secret. Everyone was curious, but they all knew that when the teacher said it was a secret, that meant it was something that the teacher didn't want them to see. However, when the class was over, the teacher opened the bag. Clover took a peek inside, there were three tiny cakes, and each of the cakes had Lavender, Clover, and Rose's names written on them using blueberry icing. It turned out the teacher had prepared a little treat for them to congratulate them for a month of learning here! 
           Just when they were about to return to their own homes, Sesame came, Sesame knew everyone in the neighborhood and was good friends with Clover and Rose. Still nibbling on his cake pop, he squeaked: "What are you guys holding, show me!" Everyone pretended that they were holding some dancing supplies. When Sesame was about to go, "Thump!" Clover's cake fell on the floor. Before she could pick it up, Sesame sped back, Clover didn't want to lie to her friend, so she decided to tell the truth, it turned out everyone thought the same. They soon found out they made the right decision. Sesame took out his tiny notepad, jotted down some stuff, and ran toward the dance studio, he returned in only a few minutes. He said: "Follow me, I planned some fun!" Everyone followed Sesame back to the dance studio only to find that it had been transformed into a completely different place, there were lights and party flags everywhere, and there was also a giant banner saying: "LETS HAVE SOME FUN!!!" It turned out the cakes inspired Sesame to host a party! They were having a great time eating the cakes and dancing, Sesame even showed off some hammy dancing!
            Mochi found out Sesame still wasn't back at midnight so she decided to find him herself, When she walked through the neighborhood, she heard a loud noise coming from the dance studio. So she decided to look there, and she was even more surprised when she saw the four of them partying and eating cakes together, so she took Sesame home and told the others to keep partying and do what they wanted. Back home, Sesame went to bed straight away waiting for a very special day…

        <h2>Mochi's Birthday Cake</h2>                     
        <p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Mochi woke up bright and early to a very special day. It was her birthday! So she went to the hammy playground, expecting to see Sesame practicing his moves again, but when she got there, she heard a bunch of voices say: "Happy birthday, Mochi!" All of her friends were at the party, The place had been transformed from a normal playground to a birthday wonderland, there were ribbons everywhere, and pink, yellow, and purple balloons filled the air, the birthday cake, which had endless layers of fruits sat on the tree trunk, which had been repurposed to a table. Just when she looked at the giant happy birthday banner, Sesame gently pulled Lavender's fur, Lavender knew what Sesame meant as this was their secret code that they somehow took ages to settle on. Lavender shot rainbow, heart-shaped confetti everywhere. This sudden burst of confetti surprised Mochi, but she was soon amazed at what she saw because it looked like it was raining rainbow hearts!
            Mochi woke up bright and early to a very special day. It was her birthday! So she went to the hammy playground, expecting to see Sesame practicing his moves again, but when she got there, she heard a bunch of voices say: "Happy birthday, Mochi!" All of her friends were at the party, The place had been transformed from a normal playground to a birthday wonderland, there were ribbons everywhere, and pink, yellow, and purple balloons filled the air, the birthday cake, which had endless layers of fruits sat on the tree trunk, which had been repurposed to a table. Just when she looked at the giant happy birthday banner, Sesame gently pulled Lavender's fur, Lavender knew what Sesame meant as this was their secret code that they somehow took ages to settle on. Lavender shot rainbow, heart-shaped confetti everywhere. This sudden burst of confetti surprised Mochi, but she was soon amazed at what she saw because it looked like it was raining rainbow hearts!
Suddenly, everyone said they had to go home because they had "things to do". Mochi was extremely disappointed, Sesame said: "How about we go play at the dance studio!" Mochi reluctantly agreed, so Sesame hopped to the dance studio with Mochi, who still wasn't sure what was going on, following him. He said: "Wait, you have to put your blindfold on!" So Sesame let Mochi put her blindfold on and walk into the dance studio. Just as she was about to go in, the amazing sound of the happy birthday song caught her ear. It was loud and sounded amazing, it was rhythmic and sounded awesome, it sounded like the best music you could ever listen to, it was perfect. When Sesame took off her blindfold, she was even more surprised to find that Lavender, Clover, and Rose were dancing and singing!
If you're wondering how they could sing so well, it started with an idea someone came up with a month ago. It was Lavander, Clover, and Rose's first dancing class, and none of them knew how to dance. When it was finally break time, Rose said:
 "It's going to be Mochi's birthday next month, so how about we try to make our dancing as good as possible and then practice singing at home so we can prepare for Mochi's birthday party!" Everyone was excited about Mochi's birthday party so they all agreed. However, everyone forgot after only a few days, but only Rose remembered. This is also why Rose became the teacher's favorite student.
"Now let's go back to eat the cake!" suggested Clover. But when they got there, the cake was gone, and in its place was a tiny note saying: "Catch me if you can!" At first, they all thought Sesame took the cake somewhere else. But when they tried to find Sesame, they quickly spotted him practicing a new move. So they called him down, and Mochi asked him: "Why did you take my cake?" "I didn't take the cake, I don't even know what happened to the cake!" answered Sesame, his tiny eyes shimmering in the sun, filled with innocence.
Just when they were about to give up, Hazelnut spotted a trail of honey paw prints on her side, "If we want to find the cake, we'll have to figure out where these paw prints lead!" suggested Hazelnut. Everyone agreed, so they followed the paw prints and tried to find who had taken the cake. At first, the paw prints were effortless to see. After a few minutes of following the trail, the paw prints were smudged and seemed to be lighter. Sesame noticed they weren't looking at him, so he quietly ran to the dance studio to meet his friend Ramen, who was decorating the cake with honey cake pops and peanut donuts. Soon, the trail almost completely disappeared but was followed by a trail of paper napkins that led them to the dance studio. At the dance studio, they saw Sesame and Ramen decorating the cake with a bunch of honey cake pops, some peanut donuts, and A LOT of candied strawberries. Before long, the cake had been turned from a cake without a single topping into a masterpiece filled with many layers of flavor.
As the sun began to set, everyone knew it was time to celebrate Mochi's birthday. "Make a wish, what are you waiting for!" squeaked Ramen. "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you..." The sound of the happy birthday song had caught her ear once more. This time, it was better than before. It was vibrant and sounded incredible, it was melodic and sounded fantastic, it sounded like the finest tunes imaginable, it was flawless. When she turned her head, Lavender, Clover, Rose, Hazelnut, Sesame, and Ramen were all dancing and singing. Sesame and his friend Ramen even performed some hammy dancing! Ramen jumped and formed all sorts

of moves in the air, Sesame did the same moves to make it look like they were mirroring each other. Next, Sesame did a backflip, followed by a summersault, Ramen did the same. They did the same moves repeatedly but with different variations until the song was over.
Finally, it was time for Mochi to make a wish. As soon as Hazelnut lit the candles, Mochi made a wish and blew out the candles. Now that the candles have been blown out, they could eat the cake. The upgraded cake looked much better than before. Six honey cake pops formed a flower on the center of the cake, and four peanut donuts decorated the outer ring of the cake. "Cut into the cake!" Sesame was so excited he couldn't help yelling at Mochi. As Mochi slowly cut into the cake, small candied strawberries spilled out of the cake and onto the tree trunk.
As Mochi kept slicing the cake, a few pieces of strawberry fell to the side of her paw. It looked so sweet and yummy that she couldn't help eating it. As soon as the strawberry hit her tongue, the layer of candy began to melt, releasing a sweet fragrance. It was smooth and silky, it was sweet and sticky, it was amazing. Soon after the layer of candy melted in her mouth, she tasted something that she'd never tried before. It tasted so different from the candy layer but went so well with it. That amazing thing she tasted was the dried strawberries from "Hazelnut's Coffee Corner" that she somehow never tried before. It was soft and chewy, and the more she chewed it, the sweeter it got. Eventually, she finished it, but the sweet and sugary taste still echoed in her mouth. Finally, they could eat the cake, a delicacy that they'd been longing for the whole time. Mochi bit into her slice, she soon found out that she was going to have a new favorite food. It was a perfect mix of honey, peanuts, and candied strawberries. Overall, there was one thing everyone all agreed on, and that is the upgraded cake was much better than the original, even some of the best cakes they had ever had.
"How about we all say happy birthday to Mochi to end this party!" suggested Sesame. Everyone liked this idea, so Sesame whispered: "I say 3, 2, 1, and we all say happy birthday at the same time!" "3, 2, 1" whispered Sesame again. Everyone knew what to do, so they waited until Sesame finished what he said and screamed: "Happy birthday, Mochi!" And with that, they ended Mochi's birthday party with lots of laughter and lots of happiness.

        <h2>The Secret Ingredient</h2>
        <p>It was a normal day in "Hazelnut's Coffee Corner," but no one came, as if they had forgotten this place existed. With no one to chat with, Hazelnut felt extremely bored. Just then, an idea struck her: she could host a bake-off! It would work so well. It would be fun for everyone, and this place would be filled with people again, just like before! As soon as she thought about it, she got to work. She borrowed a few sheets of paper from the dance studio, glued them together to form a giant sheet of paper, and wrote: "THE BIG BAKE-OFF! Location: Hazelnut's Coffee Corner" in different colors to create an enormous banner. Then, she got some string and hung it on the hammy playground's most eye-catching place. 
            After a few minutes, Sesame came and grabbed a honey cake pop like usual and hopped to the hammy playground to practice a new move that he'd always wanted to try before. When he arrived, his tiny eyes took no effort to spot the banner that Hazelnut hung. He was more excited than ever. He always loved to participate in all sorts of events! Without practicing his moves, he hopped back home and loudly squeaked: "Hazelnut hosted a bake-off, it sounds so fun!" Suddenly, Mochi didn't feel like staying on her bed anymore, she shot straight up and said: "Come on, I always wanted a chance to show off my cooking skills!" And with that, Mochi took Sesame to "Hazelnut's Coffee Corner" so they could participate in the event.
            When they got there, they saw everyone there, all paired up. Lavender paired with Clover and Rose paired with Ramen, so Mochi decided to pair up with Sesame. Before the bake-off, everyone thought they would win, so they all named their groups. Lavender and Clover thought their group would win because of their ability to turn ordinary things into fabulous treasures. One example is at the dance studio, where they made up their own dances. So they called their group "The Dancers." Rose thought her creativity and Ramen's cooking skills would make a perfect pair and win the contest. So they called their group "The Pros." Mochi and Sesame knew nothing about cooking, but Sesame wanted a fun name. After a lot of thinking, they finally settled on the name "The Partyers." Mochi started plotting ideas with Sesame, she said: "How about we look around to see what we're working with!" Sesame agreed. 
            So they went to the pantry, flipping through drawers and cupboards, occasionally finding a new ingredient that they could use. When Mochi looked into the last cupboard, she saw an old cookbook there, all by itself. It had a few scratch marks and pages were falling out, the colors were fading but the words were visible and fairly easy to see. Out of curiosity, she flipped to a random page in the book and looked at it. And there she had it, a perfect recipe for the bake-off. It was a fruit tart, filled with blasts of flavor, which was the best type if they wanted to win, it could surprise the judges, make them gasp at how yummy it is. It all looked pretty easy, all until they looked at the spices. It said that to make this fruit tart amazing, they needed to use a rare spice called cinnabreeze, or else all the fruity flavors would have a hard time coming together, and the result wouldn't be something you'd want to present to the judges. 
            Mochi and Sesame both wanted to make this amazing treat, so they decided to look through different shops to see which one held the rare spice they were looking for. The first shop they went to was their favorite supermarket, which was called "Hamster Market." But when they got there, all they saw were the normal spices like cinnamon, nutmeg, even vanilla, but still no cinnabreeze. Next, they came to a small spice shop. From the outside, it looks really neat and tidy, but if you walk inside, you'll find that this place has a lot of mismatched labels. Finally, they found the label for cinnabreeze, but they couldn't be entirely sure, so Sesame decided to ask the shop owner. He squeaked: "Where do I buy cinnabreeze?" The shop owner, still munching on his salad, replied: "That went out of stock a few days ago, why don't you two try out some of the other spices?" Mochi and Sesame both knew they had to go to a different store because this one didn't have the spice they were looking for. Then, they went to "Pineapple's Spice Shop," which had a variety of different spices and flavorings. It had pre-grated orange zest, it had saffron, it had turmeric, it had nutmeg, but more importantly, it had cinnabreeze. So Sesame bought 0.5 grams of cinnabreeze for their fruit tart and 0.25 grams of turmeric for some golden milk, just enough to bring out the flavor without overwhelming their tiny taste buds.
            Soon, Mochi and Sesame came back from the spice shop, just in time for the bake-off. Finally, it was time to show off their cooking skills and impress the judges. With their handy cookbook in hand, cooking was no hard task. She dumped 5 tiny spoonfuls of flour and half a spoon of sugar into her bowl while Sesame dumped 3 spoons of melted butter into the bowl and worked the dough together to form the pastry of their tart. Next, Mochi shaped the pastry into small balls of dough and pressed them into Hazelnut's adorable paw-shaped molds. It was time to make her favorite part, it was the fruity filling that Mochi was so excited to make. First, she chopped up a piece of kiwi and some strawberries. Then, she poured some water into a pan, dusted some powdered sugar into the water, and in went the kiwis and strawberries. Mochi told Sesame to keep an eye on the pan while she went to bake the crust. Sesame did as Mochi said, stirring occasionally and turning off the heat when the filling reached a syrupy texture, according to the recipe. 15 minutes later, Mochi returned with a golden brown crust, steaming with a buttery fragrance. She carefully poured the filling into the crust and put it into the cooling chamber to let it set. While they were waiting for their fruit tart to set, they decided to start making their golden milk. Sesame put a pinch of turmeric into his tiny mug while Mochi added some milk, just enough to fill Sesame's mug. Mochi used a spoon the size of your thumb to stir everything together into a perfect glass of golden milk. 5 more minutes later, the fruit tart was ready to take out of the fridge. And with a light sprinkle of cinnabreeze, it was finally done.
            With the bright red from the strawberries, the zesty green from the kiwis, and the warm yellow hue from the cinnabreeze, Mochi and Sesame both thought this would win them the competition. But they couldn't be sure, because who knows what delicious treats the other teams whipped up.
            The judge, Hazelnut, couldn't wait to try out everyone's amazing treats because she felt they were all going to be delicious. First up was Mochi and Sesame's vibrant fruit tart. "It has a sprinkle of cinnabreeze on it."  introduced Mochi. Hazelnut was so surprised that she let out a loud squeak: "I've always wanted to try that, it sounds amazing!" When she took a bite, the blasts of flavor made her want to eat the whole thing. Mochi also took a bite, it was the best thing she had ever tasted, the zing from the fruits, the creaminess from the crust, and the light, airy feel from the cinnabreeze, it was amazing. Hazelnut was surprised again by the texture of Rose and Ramen's sugar cookies and the layers of flavor in Lavender and Clover's cake pop.
            Finally, it was time to pick the winner. Hazelnut said: "It's so hard to pick!" Moments later, Hazelnut continued: "Everyone's a winner!" All the teams were so happy to have won the contest, they couldn't help but do some dancing. And with that, the day came to an end in an eternity of excitement.

        <h2>Spring Cleaning</h2>
        <p>Clover woke up to a sunny morning. The sun was shining, the air was fresh, and even the earth beneath her paws felt warmer than before. She was so excited, it was finally her favorite time of year: spring cleaning! Her favorite thing was to see the dusty streets get cleaned again, and her favorite part was throwing sakura petals all over the ground, which was the hamsters' tradition. She wanted to start right away, but she knew that she had to wait for her friends to wake up so they could clean together, so she decided to go back to bed and wait until the clock at the hammy playground struck 9.
            "Ding dong!" The clock struck 9 and everyone woke up to the cleanest day in a year. Sesame whipped out his miniature broom and started sweeping randomly but because this was his first time doing this, he got dust everywhere and the streets were messier than before, so Mochi stood aside to teach Sesame how to sweep and mop the ground correctly while the others swept the ground.
           Clover borrowed Sesame's broom and started sweeping all the dust to the side of the street, it already looked brighter than before, the warm color that was once covered by dust was finally uncovered, and the earthy smell of the soil was finally revived. With just a few more sweeps, the place seemed to be brand new, just like before.
            In the meanwhile, Mochi was still teaching Sesame how to sweep the ground, Sesame's eyes were wide open, his little ears twitching to Mochi's words as if each word was crucial. Next, Mochi got Sesame's broom back and demonstrated how to sweep the ground correctly. She held the broom with both paws, gently swept the dust to the side, and collected it with a small trash can. She told Sesame to try it out to make sure he really knew how to sweep the ground. Sesame used his tiny paws to grab the handle, then proceeded to copy Mochi's moves. "You finally learned how to sweep the ground, now you can join us on every spring cleaning!" exclaimed Mochi. 
           Sesame was proud of his own progress and soon got to work, he swept the floor until it had no more dust on it, and he also mopped the floor and polished everything until all of them were nice and shiny. They worked together and soon, the streets were cleaner than ever.
           But they weren't done yet, because they still had to clean their rooms, the hammy playground, the dance studio, and the cafe to polish this day. The first place they cleaned was Mochi and Sesame's room, and if you look inside, chances are you'll find it an absolute mess. So everyone prepared to clean up this mess and make it the neatest burrow possible. The first step was to move out all the hay that made Mochi and Sesame's bed. Then, Sesame polished this room with a tiny, gray-blue cloth so not even a speck of dust was in sight. Mochi and Clover both thought the art piece that Sesame put on the wall looked a bit tilted, so she tried to make it face the right direction, after playing around with the strings a little bit, it was finally in the perfect direction. Lavender and Mochi picked up the hay that Mochi slept on, held it over the trash can, and shook all the dust off. After a bit more polishing, it was time to actually organize the room. The organization was pretty simple, all they had to do was spread around the hay so the bed would be nice and even so Mochi could have a good night's sleep today. 
           Even though Mochi's room was a mess, Rose's room was unbelievable, her tutus were everywhere, her perfumes scattered around the room, it was so messy that it was hard to look at without rolling your eyes. Sesame, however, now loved to clean, hopped into the room and got to work right away. He collected all of Rose's perfumes into a small tote bag to prevent them from damage while he cleaned the rest of Rose's room. Rose felt that she had to be responsible for cleaning her own room, so she joined Sesame while the others simply watched. Rose used a piece of yellow cloth with a lot of flowers printed on it to make the photo she hung on the wall sparkly clean while Sesame swept all the dust on the floor into one big pile, he then collected it into a small trash can. Rose glanced over at her bed, all her tutus were piled up on her bed, and she felt like she had to do something. So she walked over to her bed and folded the tutus one by one, the delicate fabric rustling in her hands as. she smoothed the corners. Next, she stacked the folded tutus and put them into the corner that she normally puts them in.
           It was finally time to clean the hammy playground, which was Sesame and Ramen's favorite place to play, even Ramen who didn't like cleaning that much joined him. Thinking about playing in a clean playground motivated Ramen to clean the place, so he got to work immediately. Ramen was in charge of polishing the slide and Sesame was in charge of cleaning the swings. Ramen asked for a piece of cloth from Rose, and Rose agreed. Ramen hopped to the slide and used the wet cloth to clean the ladder, making sure to hit every nook and cranny. Next up was the hardest part, which was cleaning the slide itself, because it had rained last night, and no one dried it out, the slide was extra slippery. Ramen walked back and forth, not knowing what to do. Suddenly, an idea struck him, nodding to himself, he thought: "This will work amazing!" Certain that his idea would work, he got to work right away. He got a clean piece of cloth, sat on it, and down the slide he went. This worked perfectly, not only was the slide dry, but it was also really clean, and most importantly, Ramen had fun. He thought to himself: "Maybe cleaning isn't so boring after all, I should help with it more often!" And if you look at Sesame, you'll find that he's still working on the swings to make them both very dry and very clean. Inspired by Ramen's way that he used to clean the slide, Sesame decided to give it a go too. He fetched the cloth that Ramen used, also sat on it, and started playing on the swings, the cloth soaked up the water, making the swings dryer than ever. While the cloth was soaking up water, Sesame was going up and down, having a lot of fun. Within a few minutes, everyone was done, Sesame and Ramen were more excited than ever thinking about having a clean playground to play in, and the others just smiled.
           The last place they needed to clean was "Hazelnut's Coffee Corner." This was the place that they had all been waiting for, because who doesn't want to sip their coffee and eat their donuts in a clean, comfortable place! Hazelnut said: "How about we clean the corners first!" Everyone agreed, knowing that this would make the corners both cleaner and more comfy to stay in. Now eager to clean, Ramen wet his cloth and dashed to the corners, preparing to make them cleaner than before. He used his paws to stick the cloth deep into the corner so he could get the dust out. Within a minute or two, you could barely see that anything was there in the first place. Hazelnut decided that she would clean the glass cabinets and countertops since it was her cafe. She rinsed Ramen's cloth and used it to wipe the cabinets. But she didn't stop there, she also used a dry paper towel to pat the glass dry so no water marks stayed there. And soon, the glass was clearer than ever, and everyone could see the detail on the pastries once more. After she cleaned the glass pretty easily, it was time for her to polish the countertop. She started by rinsing the cloth again, then she laid it flat on the countertop and started to wipe the center as well as the edges. And to prevent the water soaking into the wood, she used another paper towel to dry the surface. The last step was to sweep the floor, which I'm pretty sure we all know who's going to be in charge. Sesame went out of nowhere and used the same method Mochi taught him to make the floor so clean you could sleep on it.
           But that wasn't the end because they still had to make it rain sakura petals for their tradition. All of them went up the highest stick in the hammy playground with a big box of sakura petals, each of their paws all grabbing onto it. As soon as the clock struck 12, they all turned the box upside-down, producing a breathtaking view.
           And with that, they ended the cleanest day of a year with a spectacular rain of sakura petals. Before Sesame went to bed, he thought to himself: "Cleaning is fun!"

        <h2>A Dance Class For Everyone</h2>
        <p>Rose was practicing her dancing in the dance studio, she twirled in circles, jumped into the air to do a backflip, only to do it over and over again. Maybe it was the repeating dance moves that made her bored, she sat on the bench on the side of the room, not knowing what to do. She thought: "I should do something with my dance skills, but what would that thing be?" After some more dancing, she finally got an idea: she could call Lavender and Clover and convince them to teach a dance class with her! She decided to visit Clover first because Rose knew Clover, and she knew that Clover would agree to any kind of request. Rose ran to the dance studio and found Clover practicing the moves they had learned in their last dance class. As soon as Clover saw Rose coming, she stopped dancing and ran over to Rose, she squeaked: "Rose! Are you here to dance, or is there something else I need to know?" Rose, completely overwhelmed by Clover's fast words, replied: "Would you mind if we and Lavender teach a dance class together, just for a little bit of fun." Clover imagined teaching a dance class to everyone. There would be classical music playing, maybe even a little bit of jazz because Sesame and Ramen wanted to do some hammy-dancing. She thought about what it would do, everyone would know how to make graceful dance moves, and Ramen and Sesame might even want to show everyone some more hammy-dancing! Without a hint of regret, she agreed. "Now let go and wake Lavender up!" suggested Rose. So the two hopped to Lavender's home only to find that Lavender was still sleeping on her bed, not wanting to wake up. Rose and Clover whispered to each other and soon got a plan. Clover went outside and spotted some dandelions at the hammy playground right away, so she grabbed a bunch before hopping back to Lavender's home to join Rose and wake Lavender up. Now that she was back at Lavender's home, the two split the fluffy, white balls and began to reach for Lavender's face. As the soft, wispy seeds gently brushed Lavender's face, still not opening her eyes, she tried to brush the seeds away, until, "ACHOO!" She woke up with a loud sneeze, still a bit sleepy, she asked: "What are you doing here?" "We were wondering if you'd like to teach a dance class with us, it's going to be so much fun! I mean, it would be a pity if a dance master like YOU didn't come," replied Rose. The idea of teaching a dance class hit Lavender like a splash of ice-cold water. It made her wake up quickly, ready to join Rose and Clover as a group of dance teachers, preparing to make everyone in the neighborhood enjoy the art of dancing and know how wonderful it is.
They borrowed some of the dance studio's supplies and started by grabbing some crayons to turn the strip of paper that they also got from the dance studio into a banner. Rose and Lavender didn't know how to draw but they both knew that Clover loved to draw and could make any idea come to life on paper within minutes, without a doubt, she was perfect for the job. They asked Clover to draw stars and everyone in the neighborhood dancing and having fun while doing it. "No problem!" agreed Clover. Soon, Rose and Lavender watched Clover hold a yellow crayon, draw a bunch of sparkling stars, and continue to draw the same stars but with pink, orange, and mint. But she didn't stop there, because she still had to draw everyone dancing, but that was no hard task for her since she knew what everyone looked like and could draw them perfectly, so she drew Mochi doing a cartwheel	while colorful notes popped out of her mouth, she drew Sesame doing his hammy-dancing while holding a balloon with his name on it, she drew Hazelnut wearing an olive green tutu while twirling in place, and she drew Ramen trying to match Sesame's moves with his own balloon. And most importantly, she drew the three of them larger than everyone in the corner because they're the "teachers." Even though Clover could make any idea come to life on paper, her calligraphy was not the best, and everyone knew who to ask.
Out of all the hamsters in the neighborhood, not a single one of them didn't see the banner that Hazelnut hung at the bake-off. They all knew that Hazelnut may be a barista, but that doesn't mean she can't be good at calligraphy. Hazelnut, with her ability to make words look like they're ready to jump off the page, was the perfect hamster to ask. All of them decided to go together just so they could convince Hazelnut to do some beautiful calligraphy. Lavender couldn't help but think about the wonderful calligraphy that Hazelnut would write. The letters would swirl like soft ocean waves, each curve would look like it resembled something, and every single stroke would be as fluid as a drop of water. When they arrived at Hazelnut's cafe, Lavender was so excited that words popped out of her mouth before she even realized it: "Hazelnut, so we're trying to host this dance class, and we're going to need a banner for decoration, it's going to say 'LET'S DANCE,' so can you help us write on the banner? You'll be invited too, and it's going to be really fun! we have an olive green tutu for you, are you okay with that or do you want something like pink?" Hazelnut was completely overwhelmed by Lavender's questions, after a while, she replied with a smile: "First of all, thanks for inviting me, it sounds like so much fun! I never danced before, but I'll give it a go. And seriously, what reason do I have not to write a banner for my best friend? Oh, and I almost forgot about the dress, olive green is perfect, it's my absolute favorite color!" So Hazelnut followed the three back at the dance studio to write the banner. A minute later, she was done. It was exactly how Lavender imagined, if not better. The purple ink swirled on the paper, ready to jump off any time. 
After Hazelnut finished, she even offered to help hang the banner and decorate the dance studio. So now there's an extra helper which will help things go extra fast at the dance studio. So the four headed back to the dance studio and started by hanging the banner. Everyone had their own task, Rose and Lavender were in charge of hanging the banner, Clover and Rose didn't want to go that high up, so they decided to keep their paws on the ground and be in charge of passing the tools to Rose and Lavender. With Hazelnut's help, they finished in no time, and the only things left were decorating the place and setting up a music playlist to go with all the dance moves everyone would learn. Next, Clover entered the other room and dived into a pile of ribbons and confetti, only to scoop up a bunch for the decor. The confetti was nothing too complex, all they had to do was spread it around evenly so it looked cool. And the ribbons weren't too hard either, all they had to do was to tie it onto the balloons, and that's pretty much it. And for the most fun part, the mini fan that Lavender used to keep cool made the bright yellow and red ribbons wave like the dancing flames on the stovetop, Lavender put her fan on the ground, forgetting	to turn it off, resulting in some dancing confetti as well.  Inspired by the dancing confetti and Lavender's fan, she loudly said: "Let's put some fans on the side of the room so the confetti will dance, it'll make a nice effect!" "This is a great idea!" squeaked Hazelnut, "But where do we find fans?" Lavender thought for a moment, trying to remember where she got the fans, she turned around and replied: "Sesame has a huge stash in his secret hiding spot, we can borrow some, we'll just say it's for a project!"
Hazelnut led the way to Mochi's home, not forgetting to turn back and tell the others to act like everything was normal so it didn't spoil the surprise for him. After more walking, talking, and wandering around, they finally arrived at Mochi's house, only to see Mochi sitting there, eating her morning salad while Sesame was still sleeping. Rose stepped out and said: "Hey Mochi, so um we want to borrow some of Sesame's fans for like this really cool project and we need about four or five of them, is that okay with him, or does he not care." Mochi replied: "Oh, he doesn't care, as long as there's at least one that he can use! I'll get you some right away!" Mochi went into Sesame's secret hiding spot and fiddled around with the fans for a bit until she found the prettiest, most delicate ones that she knew her friends would love.	
Hazelnut really wanted to help set up the fans and the music, so the others all agreed and let her follow them. But as soon as they got to the dance studio, they found a problem. Sure, they could put the fans on the side of the room, but wouldn't it fall over? Glue? That wouldn't work. They still have to return it. So they spent some time thinking and discussing about this, until...a great idea struck Lavender. "We can use washi tape, it will make the fans come off without damaging it or the wall, and it looks good!" Everyone thought this was a great idea and Rose ran straight back to her house, got that roll of washi tape she never really used, and ran straight back to join the others. "WOW! This pattern is perfect, it really matches the vibe we're going for!" The others weren't joking, the tape had a graceful and colorful flower pattern, it wasn't just a roll of washi tape, it was a tiny ecosystem contained in a roll of tape. Now that they got their tape, it was time to tape all the fans on the side of the wall. Hazelnut held the fans in place while Lavender taped them on, but the other two weren't just watching, they were busy setting up a playlist and trying to get the right volume.
But soon, they got everything just right and the class was ready to start. With Hazelnut's help, the word spread in no time and all the hamsters were here, their eyes gleaming with excitement, excited for what was going to come next. What were Rose, Clover, and Lavender going to teach them? Rose said: "But first, shouldn't all of us be in our tutus? I got all of us one, it has our names on it" And Hazelnut, of course, got her olive green tutu with her name on it, everyone changed into their tutus, even Sesame and Ramen. After they changed, Ramen couldn't help but ask: "Whoa, what's up with the flying confetti?" Before Clover could talk, Sesame replied: "My sister told me that they borrowed my fans for a project, I guess this is their project." Then, Mochi asked: "These dresses are so pretty, and mine even has my name on it!" Clover replied: "We found these dresses at the dance studio, we sewed the names on, it was so fun!" 
"Question time is up, it's time to dance!" reminded Clover. Lavender said: "First class, let's learn to do a pirouette, a classic move." The "teachers" demonstrated the moves, then declared that everyone practice by themselves for 5 minutes. Clover couldn't help but laugh at what everyone got themselves into. Sesame and Ramen wobbled a bit but soon got the hang of it, but then the funniest possible thing happened, they wobbled again and fell, Rose went over and helped them get up, trying to hide a laugh. The others were focused, trying to do the perfect move, but all of them seemed to wobble and slip at that last moment. Hazelnut nailed it on her first try, but when she tried to spin gracefully, she just had a hard time changing her direction. Lavender squeaked with a voice that everyone could hear: "Practice time is up!" 
Clover went over to Ramen and Sesame and helped them keep their balance while instructing them on what to do. Rose helped the others nail it instead of failing at that last moment and Lavender started teaching everyone to keep their balance.
In the end? All of them learned to do the classic move that everyone knew and loved. "Class over!" declared Rose.

<h1>Summer Joy</h1>
    <section>
    <h2>It's Raining</h2>
   <p>Sesame and Mochi were still snuggling under their warm, cozy covers, the soft, comfy bedding scattered the whole room. For some reason, Sesame wasn't sleepy anymore, and really wanted to practice his moves with Mochi today. So he let out a loud yawn, and screamed as loud as he could: "WAKE UP, MOCHI" Mochi, her eyes barely opening, said: "What, Sesame." "Now that we had that dance class, you should've got a taste of what dancing is like, so can you practice my moves with me, it'll be so much fun!" So Mochi used her paws to help her get up before going out and telling Sesame to go with her. Sesame said: "Let's learn to do a cartwheel first!" But just as they were about to try it out, "drip," a drop of rain fell on Sesame's forehead, and before they even realized it, hundreds, maybe thousands of raindrops were falling from the sky. "IT'S RAINING!" exclaimed Mochi, "LET'S GO BACK AND PUT OUR RAINCOATS ON!" "OKAY!" replied Sesame. In no time, the two were back, wearing their fresh green raincoats made with the biggest mint leaves they could find from the raincoat-making competition. Now that they were in their coats, not only did they look fantastic with the leaves, but they were also "waterproof." 
    Mochi was so excited because this was the first rain of summer, the beginning of a vibrant season. She was almost overwhelmed by happiness as this was the season she looks forward to every year. The puddles were crystal-clear, only with a hint of mud, so it was perfect for splashing around and getting your paws dirty, which is always fun! The warm sunlight shone into the burrow, making everyone feel a wave of warmth, almost like a messenger going door-to-door and informing everyone about this great news. The season was hot but also refreshing. It was the perfect season to be eating ice cream, there was just something so incredible about that light, creamy taste that everyone knew and loved. Everyone agrees that ice cream is so yummy, even for just one day. 
    Maybe it was the heat wave that woke everyone up, everyone came out to play and was ready to have a lot of fun. Ramen excitedly hopped into the deepest puddle, ready to make a giant splash. As soon as Ramen's tiny paws hit the water, small waves of water began to come out. He landed with a big splash, and water flew everywhere, making everyone's raincoats wet. The water went from clear to a bit muddy, but that doesn't get in the way of them having some fun! Clover turned her head around only to see a giant puddle, so she decided they would all jump in together and make the biggest splash in hamster history. They all thought this was a great idea. So they formed a circle around the puddle, Clover said: "3, 2, 1." And they jumped in at the same time, making a truly epic splash, water flew all around, making a small rain in a big one. 
    "Now what do we play?" asked Sesame, Rose replied: "Of course, we gotta have some fun with water balloons." "Hmm, but where do we even find water balloons, I don't have any!" a confused Sesame said. "I have loads at my house, it'll be so much fun!" replied Rose. Without saying another word, Rose sped back to her home, grabbed a small bag of water balloons, making sure to get the light green ones because everyone liked light green, and ran right back. As soon as Sesame saw Rose's stash of balloons, he couldn't help but yell: "Where on earth do you get so many balloons?" Rose smiled: "I remember they have some on sale at 'Toyland,' and it's not really far, just a few steps away!" Just as Rose finished her sentence, everyone rushed over to the bag and each grabbed 2. 
    They all had their own way of playing the game. Sesame and Ramen picked up a thin branch from the ground, poked a hole so small it was barely noticeable, and used them as water guns to shoot each other. And for the others? Mochi and Hazelnut started juggling them around and wanted to see whose balloon was last to hit the ground, both of them were starting strong, but Hazelnut's paw missed the balloon by only a tiny bit, and the balloon dropped to the floor with a satisfying and loud splash. But they couldn't know yet because Hazelnut still had one balloon, and Mochi had two, so the game started again, they still began by juggling the balloons, but this time, Mochi slipped and her paw missed the balloon, making it drop to the floor, creating an explosive splash. So it's now tied and they were heading into the tie-breaker round, they juggled the balloon as usual, Mochi slipped again, and Hazelnut won. Meanwhile, Rose, Clover, and Lavender were excitedly bursting the balloons and watching the water burst straight out. 
    "Let's go to the cafe for a break!" suggested Hazelnut. Everyone thought this was a great idea so they followed Hazelnut to the cafe only to find that there was a caramel cappuccino for almost everyone, Sesame and Ramen can't drink coffee yet so they got caramel milk with lots of strawberry whipped cream on it made just for them. And not surprisingly, Sesame and Ramen both gave it a 5 out of 5. And the others had their eyes closed in caramel bliss. The caramel paired wonderfully with the milky and smooth coffee, she took a tiny sip out of it, the caramel almost melted into the silky, almost velvety coffee. The thick, frothy cream on the drink looked unbelievably yummy, and the caramel sauce looked perfect with a pinch of sea salt to top it off. Mochi couldn’t help but take a huge bite out of the cream, As soon as the sweet and salty mix touched her tiny tongue, the creamy taste went to every corner of her mouth, making her not just taste it, but actually feel it. Moments later, the sweet and salty caramel sauce finally reached her mouth, the creaminess of the cream, the sweet flavor of the caramel, and the salty touch the sea salt gave melted into her tongue all at once, performing a delicious melody of caramel, sea salt, and cream in her mouth. "WOW!" exclaimed Mochi, and she wasn't overreacting, that pinch of sea salt went really well with the rich, velvety caramel sauce. The caramel was really sweet and yummy, but a tiny pinch of sea salt balanced some of the sugary flavors out and added a salty and refreshing touch.
    "Drip drop!" The seemingly never-ending rain's last drop of water finally fell to the ground. With that, everyone waved goodbye to Hazelnut and finished their drinks, happy and content.

            <h2>The Berry Festival</h2>
            <p>Today was a special day. The sun was shining, the lush bushes looked greener than before, and ripe, juicy berries hung on the branches like ornaments hanging on a Christmas tree. It was the berry festival, the festival that all the hamsters look forward to every year. It was not just a festival, but a time to enjoy fresh berries and feel the wonderful environment of the neighborhood garden.
                "Ding dong!" The clock at the hammy playground struck 9, and every single hamster woke up to a full day of berries. Hazelnut was the first to wake up, but instead of going by herself, she decided it was best to call all her friends so they could have the best time ever. Her first destination was Mochi and Sesame's home. There, she found Mochi and Sesame drinking banana oat smoothies. As soon as she got in, she was warmly greeted with a smoothie invitation from Mochi: "Hey Hazelnut! You're early today, so how about you try me and Sesame's banana oat smoothies? I used the leftover cinnabreeze from last time and it's so rich and creamy!" Hazelnut, just realizing she was early, squeaked: "Okay! I'll try some, I was so excited I forgot to have breakfast!" She saw Mochi sit down by a small wooden table, put a few small chunks of banana in her blender, add a cup of rolled oats, add just a bit of milk, add a dash of cinnabreeze, and blend. Before long, a delicious and oaty smoothie was made before Hazelnut's eyes and now was the time to taste it. She took a sip, it was a perfect smoothie, the oats gave it that creamy texture while the banana gave it that sweet taste. Hazelnut soon found herself drinking the whole thing. "WOW! That is so good, I should make this at the cafe!" exclaimed Hazelnut. "So, let's go to the garden and pick some berries, I bet the others are already there!" suggested Sesame. 
                Sesame was right. When they got there they saw the others busy picking sweet, juicy berries from the branches. Sesame and Ramen were so excited when they saw this many berries, they couldn't help but get a basket and start picking berries. They picked the berries as fast as they could, and before long, their baskets were filled with some delightfully sweet berries, screaming to be eaten. So they carefully stepped aside and each took out a blueberry, after making sure no one was looking, they started nibbling on the berries. It was the best experience they've ever had, the blueberries were packed with flavor, they were not only filled with juice, but they were also irresistibly fresh, almost like eating nature's candy. In the meanwhile, the others were carefully picking the berries from the branches. The delicate berries shimmered in the sunlight, like colorful gems gleaming under the soft sunlight. Clover saw exactly 1 raspberry and 1 blackberry, the raspberry looked like a bright ruby with its vibrant colors, the sun’s light bounced off the blackberry, making it look unbelievably yummy. Clover was filled with joy because this was her favorite type of berries, before the thought even reached her mind, she found herself putting these berries into her basket. Hazelnut was the fastest to fill her basket because she was so hyped up she picked those berries like a whirlwind, her paws moving faster than anyone could imagine! Lavender, Clover, and Rose whispered to each other for a moment, then each took a blueberry out of their baskets and used them as props for every dance move they could think of, including the pirouette they taught everyone. Surprisingly, that was the one that looked best. Maybe it's because their way of holding it made it look like sapphires resting gracefully on their paws since this move doesn't have much action.
                “Now let’s go to the cafe and make some treats with all these berries!” suggested Hazelnut. Everyone was craving some sweets right now, especially Sesame and Ramen, they replied with a loud “YEAH!” while the others simply nodded. So they followed Hazelnut to the cafe and got ready to get their paws dirty making some delicious treats. “So what are we making, chef?” asked Sesame. Hazelnut had never heard someone call her chef before, still in surprise, she replied: “Let’s start with a Berry Bliss Cheesecake,  my favorite! I’m sure all of you know how good it is, I make them every summer!” Before long, she could hear many “YAY!”s in front of her. She knew she’d made the right choice, because who doesn’t like cheesecake?
                “We’ll make the filling!” squealed Sesame and Ramen, ”So what do we do?” Hazelnut joyfully replied: “Well I would love having two extra helpers in the bakery! Sesame, you get a small bowl and a spatula to start mashing one raspberry and one strawberry into a slurry. And you, Ramen, you mix Sesame’s slurry into some cream cheese and add some extra maple syrup for extra yumminess, I guess.” “And for everyone else here, how about all of us make the crust!” As soon as Hazelnut’s words hit Sesame and Ramen’s ear, they got to work immediately. Sesame grabbed a small bowl and reached for one strawberry and one raspberry, before using the spatula to mash them into one big appetizing goop. The work then fell into Ramen’s hand as he stirred the cream cheese, some maple syrup, okay maybe a LOT of maple syrup, and Sesame’s berry mixture with a small stick until it turned into a creamy, pink mix, the wonderful fragrance wafted through the air, filling the whole burrow with this amazing scent. And then there were the others, grinding up graham crackers and mixing them with a few drops of butter to form the crust of their cheesecake. It was finally time to put the cheesecake together and enjoy their delicious creations. The first step was to press the crust into their molds, which was probably the most easy task other than scooping in the filling. Everyone, including Sesame and Ramen, each got a small piece of dough and pressed it into the mold before spooning in the filling that Sesame and Ramen worked together to make. and with that, the cheesecake was ready to go in the cafe’s secret cooling chamber to set.
                After a few minutes, the delightfully sweet cheesecake was ready to eat. The hamsters sat in a circle at the hammy playground, each grabbing a slice of their wonderfully pink berry cheesecake. As the hamsters savored their cheesecakes, they all concluded that the yummiest of cheesecakes always comes from the little moments shared, and the feeling of being together made everything a little sweeter……

            <h2>Lemonberry Delight</h2>
            <p>The hamsters still had many berries left, and Sesame thought it would be best if they used the rest by whipping up some wonderfully sweet and sour Lemonberry Delight. As soon as Sesame woke up, he found his tiny feet racing to the cafe, preparing to, not just get a honey cake pop, but share this idea with the one hamster that could make yummy pastries and refreshing summer drinks possible, Hazelnut. Sesame was in front of Hazelnut in no time: “Hey Hazelnut, you know that we have a lot of berries left. Right? So I have this really cool idea, I got some lemons at my house, so how about using them up by making some berry lemonade, I already have an amazing name!” Hazelnut warmly smiled: “First of all, I think a berry lemonade is an awesome way to use up our leftover berries, I mean, I don’t see anything wrong with it. And what name did you think of?” Sesame squeaked: “So the name is Lemonberry Delight, the most fun name for a drink created by a hamster!  And I think we all have time after lunch, so that’s when we’ll do it.” Hazelnut cheerfully replied: “That sounds great! But don’t you feel like you’re missing something?” Sesame squealed: “My honey cake pop! And can I get extra sprinkles this time?” And with that, Sesame left “Hazelnut’s Coffee Corner” with, not only a cake pop, but a plan, and not just any plan, a plan for some Lemonberry Delight. Sesame could feel the anticipation growing in him, he had to tell this exciting news to Mochi! 
                So he sped back to his house, ignoring the hammy playground, and was soon right next to Mochi. 
                “Mochi, Imma tell you something FUN!” squeaked Sesame. “What is it? I love fun stuff!” replied Mochi. Sesame tried to make a mysterious face though only Mochi knows whether he succeeded or not. Finally, Sesame decided to give Mochi a hint, he whispered: “Go to the cafe after lunch, there's gonna be fun waiting for everyone!” And before Mochi could say another word, Sesame went out of his home again. This time, it was not to ask someone for help setting up an event, but to inform everyone about that event. Sesame went door to door telling everyone about the refreshing event, and every home he went to was about every 5 questions he needed to answer. For example, when he arrived at Lavender’s house, he found himself in a literal survey. Lavender asked: “When is it happening? What do I need to bring? Where is it happening, well, I mean, it’s gotta be Hazelnut’s cafe. And Is it fun?” Sesame answered Lavender’s questions one by one: “It’s right after lunch so go to Hazelnut’s cafe after you’re done, you don't need to bring anything other than your leftover berries, and it’s definitely not boring!” “Okay, I’ll make sure to be there, it sounds so cool!” And for some other homes, it took no questions to convince them to be there, they simply agreed.
                As lunchtime passed, the hamsters finished munching on their apple salads(since today is Hamster Apple Salad Day, aka HASD) and arrived at “Hazelnut’s Coffee Corner,” ready to stir up the most refreshing drink of summer and enjoy an icy mix of lemons and berries in the middle of a hot summer day.
                Mochi suddenly remembered the event at Hazelnut’s cafe and realized that now was not the time to munch on her salad slowly, so with a few more bites, she grabbed a few lemons and a couple of limes and hurried to Hazelnut’s cafe to be there and make some refreshing drinks.
                After she arrived, Hazelnut said: “Now that everyone is here, let’s start by giving those lemons and limes a good massage so that when we squeeze them, they repay us with more juice!” Ramen couldn’t help but giggle at Hazelnut’s statement, and that’s normal, I mean, who wouldn’t want to laugh when someone says “Massage the lemons so that they repay us with more juice!” Despite the words being funny, the process is enjoyable too! Everyone got a sunshine yellow lemon which were grown in the sunshine of endless summer while Sesame and Ramen got grassy green limes grown on the grassy meadows of infinite sunshine. Everyone exchanged looks as if saying: “Let’s see who's lemon has the most juice to them!” And they started massaging their lemons and limes, squeezing as hard as they could, until suddenly, Mochi pressed too hard and her lemon burst, releasing its wonderful lemony scent into the air while still having enough juice for her lemonade. Mochi thinked fast, and she soon had a plan to save this bursted lemon, she first asked for a glass, which Hazelnut quickly handed her and squeezed almost all of the lemon’s juice into the glass. And soon, the others were done squeezing their lemons and limes into their glasses, though their ways were a bit less… ”unusual.” “And now we add maple syrup and some chamomile tea which i’ve already got cooled down for all of you over there in that cup to our glasses and mash up some berry puree which you’ll have to make yourselves and garnish with some mint leaves! Oh, and I almost forgot, since it’s so hot these few days, you’ll want to grab a few ice cubes from the ice chamber, because what’s the point of making a cooling drink if you don’t add ice cubes!” Hazelnut cheerfully declared. Everyone immediately spotted the tea container in the corner and raced over to get it, but in the end, it was Clover who got her paws on the tea, so she was the first hamster to use it. she slowly poured the tea into her cup, the light fragrance slowly filling the whole room. After Clover was done, the jar was then passed one by one, so that everyone got a chance to use it and make their lemonade amazing. Now it was time to add the maple syrup, instead of everyone racing to get it, it was placed on the side of the table to be passed to the next hamster when the other one was done. After a few minutes of passing, squeezing, stirring, and taste-testing. It was finally time to add the ingredient that will make their lemonades truly amazing and taste unique, it was the berries. This was not a step that they could do themselves, but required them to work together. Hazelnut gave them a big bowl, pointing to the small pile of olive green spatulas in the corner where they grabbed their tea, thinking of the finished puree and it’s purple color, her eyes lit up, with a  tiny giggle, she squeaked: “Use this bowl to make the berry puree, you’ll need to work together for this one, because the more the better!” After Hazelnut finished her words, the hamsters got to work right away, and Hazelnut couldn't help but join the mixing fun or at least help a little. So that was why there was the scene of Hazelnut mashing the berry puree with all the others. With Hazelnut’s help, the hamsters were done in no time and the moment they had all been waiting for had finally come, it was time to pour in the puree and top everything off with a few mint leaves and a couple of ice cubes. Everyone poured a few drops of the puree and added some ice cubes only to top it off with some mint leaves which Hazelnut said would make the lemonade extra cool and perfect for a hot summer day. 
                In the end? Everyone loved their lemonades! And it took Sesame and Ramen only one sip to conclude that this concoction of limes, tea, maple syrup, and berry puree was very yummy and definitely worth all the hard work.

                    <h2>The Perfect Picnic</h2>
                    <p>Hazelnut was sitting in her cafe, she wondered: “The last two days were so fun! But then…life became normal again, how can I make today extra special?” To get an answer, she thought: “Maybe some baking will help me come up with some ideas!” So she poured some flour, added a bit of milk, a splash of oil,  and a quail egg, poured in some cranberries, and into the oven it went. A few minutes later, she had not only baked a fluffy, sweet cake, but she also baked up an idea: “We could have a picnic! I could bring this cake! Ooooooh, maybe everyone bring their own specialties from home!”  With the idea in her head, she knew the perfect hamsters to ask. So she went to the hammy playground and, of course, saw the best party planners, Sesame and Ramen playing together and practicing some hammy-dancing. She joyfully said: “I’m trying to plan a picnic, can you two help me spread the word?” Trying out the Spanish they learned yesterday, Sesame and Ramen said: “¡Obvio! ¡Y cuéntanos para la planificación!” Confused, Hazelnut said: “what does that mean?” Sesame and Ramen burst into tiny giggles, and they replied: “That means: Of course, and count us in on the planning too!” Now surprised by Sesame and Ramen’s Spanish, she laughed: “Okay, you two are too good at Spanish, and of course I have to let you two party planners be part of the planning. So your jobs are to bring yummy snacks!” Sesame and Ramen both loved all sorts of snacks so they happily agreed.
                        After Hazelnut went back to the cafe, Ramen squeaked: “So, what snacks should we bring?“ Sesame thought for a moment, then closed his eyes dreamily: EVERYTHING, I can already imagine eating cookies, donuts, our chips.” After a while, Sesame opened his eyes: “And… we could borrow the cafe to make some refreshing drinks!” “But…but Hazelnut only said to bring snacks!” reminded Ramen “Oh, I’m sure anything that can be put into your mouth is called a snack.” said Sesame. 
                        Ramen said: “Okay, so do you think we should go borrow the cafe now. I mean you’re the party master here.” Sesame giggled: “Come on, you know I don’t like hamsters calling me the party master, for the humans, I don’t care, it’s not like I know them anyways,” there was na pause, then Sesame continued, “I think we should go now, so we’ll have time to sneak a few bites out of the snacks and taste test the drinks, if they ask us, we’ll just say we were check if it was poisonous!” Ramen laughed: “Okay, but don’t say it was my idea!” Sesame said: “Come on, let’s go now!” And with that, Sesame sped to “Hazelnut’s Coffee Corner,” Ramen barely keeping up. After they arrived, they asked: “Hazelnut, can we borrow the cafe to make some snacks?” “Of course! But make sure I get to try one of your treats, I bet it’ll taste so rica!” replied Hazelnut. Sesame giggled: "So you've been learning Spanish! But for masculine nouns like treats, you would use rico, not rica." A little bit confused, Hazelnut replied: “Ummm. okay?” 
                        Now that Hazelnut allowed them to borrow the cafe, they decided to make the fruit tarts that Mochi made with a little help from Sesame and the sugar cookies Rose made with Ramen, both of them didn’t do much, but they thought they could remember the steps clear enough to try making it themselves. “Soooo, let’s make the fruit tarts first!” suggested Sesame, Ramen remembered trying the fruits tarts from last time, it was packed with sweet fruity flavors, and that cinnabreeze really was everything, without any hesitation, Ramen agreed. “But we don’t have any cinnabreeze left!” squeaked Ramen. But Sesame quickly dug into the ground and pulled out a small bag of light brown powder: “We do, last time, I loved it so much I buried a small bag, who knows. See, now it comes in handy.” In the meanwhile, Ramen pulled out a bag of flour  and poured it into a small bowl, it was all going pretty well, until Ramen accidentally added a little extra. “I mean…if we add more, we’ll have more tarts to eat…right?” asked Ramen “Of course! The more, the merrier!” squeaked Sesame. Looking at the extra flour Ramen added, Sesame realized he’ll need to add extra butter. So instead of 3 spoons of butter, Sesame added 4. The next and last step of making their crust was the mixing, this part was so fun and satisfying, Sesame and Ramen decided to do it together and have the most fun. Their tiny paws reached into the bowl at the same time only to mix the butter, sugar, and flour together into a smooth crust, almost like mashed potatoes, but better, and sweeter. “I stored some of my blueberries from the berries festival, should we make a blueberry tart instead?” asked Ramen. Sesame smiled: “one-hundred percent, I always love new flavors, the others will too.” Following the recipe from last time, they successfully made a crispy crust and a yummy blueberry filling. “Let’s pour the filling in and leave it to set so we can make the sugar cookies!” suggested Ramen. “Okay!” agreed Sesame. 
                        The sugar cookies were nothing too hard, just the same recipe for the tart crust but with two times the sugar. So they finished this pretty fast, the hard part was the icing. “Hmmm, add a can of heavy cream to a bowl and whisk for 3 to 5 minutes. This should be pretty easy!” Soon Sesame found himself pouring a can of heavy cream into a bowl and Ramen  found himself whisking together the cream to make a smooth icing. “The cookies are ready! Now we just have to spread the icing and add sprinkles, and we should also add cinnabreeze, a pinch of cinnabreeze makes everything better!” exclaimed Sesame! Ramen put on his pastel rainbow oven mittens and took out the cookies, preparing to decorate them with Sesame. Ramen took off his mittens and began smearing icing on top of the cookies with Sesame. the white icing looked like a layer of snow on top of the cookies but they weren’t done yet, because……sprinkles and cinnabreeze! Sesame added the sprinkles to the cookies, but maybe he added too much, the sprinkles completely covered the icing, and Sesame said this will make them look like a rainbow. Ramen added a pinch of cinnabreeze to each cookie, giving them a nice warm tint which made them look extra appetizing.  At this moment Ramen spotted a juice bottle in the corner and suggested they make everyone’s drinks. “But what should we make?” asked Sesame. Ramen, now filled with confidence, replied: “We’ll keep it nice and simple, just some honey water!” Sesame was amazed at this idea and quickly agreed. So they filled the bottle with water, added a squirt of honey, closed the bottle, and shaked it together to make the first drink they made all by themselves. after making all those treats, they needed a basket, and Sesame spotted one right around the corner, so he grabbed it and began loading the pastries and the bottle of honey water into the basket.
                        Just then, Hazelnut came back, with a smile, she said: “So you two are done! How about you two go to the hammy playground, the others are already there!” So Sesame and Ramen went to the hammy playground and saw everyone eating. As soon as everyone saw the two, they warmly greeted them. Lavender's eyes were fixed on their basket, she couldn’t help but ask: “What’s in that basket, is it something yummy?” Sesame and Ramen was so excited to tell everyone their creations, Sesame said: “We made blueberry fruit tarts and honey water!” Ramen continued: “And we also made sugar cookies from last time, with ‘a little extra sprinkles’ and some cream on top.”
                        Hazelnut smiled: “What are we waiting for, let’s eat the food!” Everyone loved the treats, when Rose saw the cookies, she exclaimed: “This isn’t a cookie, this is a rainbow!” When Clover tried the honey water, she said: “This is so refreshing! I love it!” When Lavender tried the blueberry fruit tarts, she asked: “How did you two make this!” Ramen giggled: It’s a secret!“
                        In the end, every hamster had their own favorite treat, and they all knew what they were going to do next time—try to make some themselves.

                    <h2>A Day Of Yummy Ice Cream</h2>
                    <p>“It’s finally ice cream day! WAKE UP, MOCHI! Let’s go have some ice cream!” squealed Sesame as he woke up to an extra hot summer day, preparing to eat a lot of ice cream. Mochi was still in her sweet dreams of cotton candy clouds and berry mountains while Sesame hopped to the hammy playground and started practicing his moves. Today was the time he tried a special move, and that move was an aerial. “I might fall,” thought Sesame, “I should do this in the sand pit!” In the sand pit, he tried extremely hard not to fall but still failed, it remained like this everytime. Until finally, he did it, he did the hardest,, most special move in his entire life, he completed his dancing dreams with this move, it’ll be the thing that’ll help him with every single dance, if he did hammy dancing now, he could do this instead of the backflips and somersaults, it would look so cool, Ramen would be impressed at his work and everyone would be amazed, he had done it. Now that he had succeeded in doing the move of his dreams, it was time to show Mochi. “Maybe Mochi isn’t up yet, I should go show Hazelnut, she’s always early, and she loves seeing my moves.” Without another thought, Sesame found his tiny feet speeding through the burrow, only to arrive at “Hazelnut’s Coffee Corner” where the words burst out of his mouth like a flowing waterfall: “Hey Hazelnut, do you have time now? I want to show you a new move I just figured out!” Hazelnut agreed. And in no time, they were back at the hammy playground, where Sesame did several aerials while Hazelnut watched in awe, not forgetting to clap between breaks. After Sesame was  done, she asked: “How did you learn that?” Sesame proudly said: “I just tried a bit and the power almost magically came to me.” Hazelnut then switched topics and asked: “Is Mochi up yet? It’s half an hour before the ice cream day celebration begins. If she isn’t, can you go wake her up? I don’t want her to miss out!” Sesame cheerfully agreed: “No problem!” Without saying another word to Hazelnut, Sesame went back home and saw Mochi, still sleeping cozily, he took a deep breath, and shouted as loud as he could: “WAKE UP MOCHI, IT’S 30 MINUTES BEFORE THE ICE CREAM DAY CELEBRATION!” As the words “ice cream” caught her ear, she didn’t  feel sleepy anymore, she wanted to go with Sesame and go to “Hazelnut’s Coffee Corner” to celebrate the ice cream that they save for only one day of ice cream, this day, of course, became Ice Cream Day, the day that all hamsters look forward to during summer.
The hamsters arrived, one by one, at “Hazelnut’s Coffee Corner,” by the time the clock struck 12, all the hamsters were gathered at the cafe, anticipating a day of ice cream. They would have ice cream making contest like they did every year, maybe even discover some new ingredients they could use. Maybe they would find new flavor combos, blueberry and nutmeg, or maybe even vanilla with orange. Who knows? Maybe some of them would taste good, but only if done right.
“So, what are we waiting for, let's dig up the ice cream and begin decorating!” squeaked Sesame. Hazelnut giggled: “Sesame, the ice cream will melt really fast once we dig it up, we need to prepare the ingredients first, then we dig up the ice cream.” Sesame laughed at himself, then replied: “Okay, I’ll go get the honeycomb! And I think there’s still some berries in the garden, I’ll go pick some! Who wants to pick up some spices at ‘Pineapples’s Spice Shop?’ I think we’ll need some nutmeg and orange zest, or maybe also some vanilla, that’ll be so yummy, and we’ll work with the ingredients that are already in the cafe, our ice creams are gonna be so yummy!” Without even saying bye, Sesame found himself hopping to the garden and picking a few blueberries to put in his basket, after that, he went to he and Mochi’s home and dug out the honeycomb that he had been saving for this very day from the wall that hung his drawing and quickly filled it up once again. And soon, he was back at the cafe, full with not only a bunch of ingredients, but ideas, and not just any ideas, but ideas for the perfect ice cream flavors and decorations. Meanwhile, Moci was at “Pineapples Spice Shop,” picking out the perfect, best tasting spices for their ice cream along with the ones Sesame mentioned to make some super yummy and flavorful ice creams. after a while, she had the perfect spices that Sesame mentioned, vanilla, nutmeg, orange zest. Along with some spices of her own choice, lemon zest, mint, and chamomile. A few minutes later, Mochi was back with many spices that would pair perfectly with the ice cream.
Just as everyone was about to dig out the ice cream, Sesame said: “Wait! Let’s not dig out the ice cream now, how about we make some syrup first, and it doen’t have to be hard, we can just get some honey and mix it with some blueberry juice and call it blueberry infused honey!” Hazelnut always loved to try make new toppings, so she excitedly squeaked: “That sounds great! And we should add so many sprinkles, like…make the ice cream a rainbow!” So they began the mixing, the blueberries were first squeezed to get the flavorful juices out, while Sesame and Ramen spent their time eating the leftover pulp. Then the juices were mixed with some honey, which made the combo turn an appetizing green color, this color resembled peace, it wasn’t just the color of the lush bushes in summer, it wasn’t just the color of the bright hay that could be found near autumn, it wasn’t just the color of the fresh sprouts that only spring  held, it wasn’t just the sonwy white that made winter truly special. It was all of them, a delicate light green filled with just a hint of the rich green that only summer held, with a dash of warm yellows, and just a tiny bit of white.
Now was the time to dig out the ice cream. Everyone was waiting for this moment, not just for ice cream, but for the joy of decorating it with each other. “It’s time to start digging!” squeaked Hazelnut. All the hamsters sunk their tiny paws into the soft earth beneath them and dug for a few minutes until their paws hit something hard, this was the ice cream box and every hamster knew that. So they stopped digging at the center and started digging at the edges until they could see an outline and continued digging until they could see the box. Now that the box was visible, all of them grabbed the top and began to gently shake it around and loosen the soil holding the box.Soon they pulled it out and took off the lid to reveal ice cream that had been preserved for a year but still remains extremely rich and creamy.
“So, what flavors should we make first?” asked Hazelnut. Before the others even had time to think, Clover said: “I have a crazy idea, and by crazy I mean crazy good. How about we drizzle some vanilla syrup on top and add some orange zest, and we should also add a lot of sprinkles, because how can you have ice cream without sprinkles!” Sesame and Ramen squealed: “We’re  gonna add so many sprinkles, we can already imagine the crunch, yum!” In the end, the orange ice cream was amazing and so was their other creations. Weird ones like blueberry nutmeg was surprisingly good and you just can’t go wrong with a classic like strawberry vanilla.
At the end of the day, everyone learned one thing, and that thing is that ice cream is and will always be awesome, no matter what flavor.

                <h1>A Sneek Peek Into Autumn</h1>
                <section>
                    <h2>A Leafy Kind Of Rain</h2>
                    <p>The trees above began to shake in the wind, leaves fluttered and fell in the soft breezes, and thousands, maybe millions of leaves were falling through the sky, into the burrow. It was the leaf rain that every hamster looked forward to during autumn, and their favorite thing to do was to gather the leaves up into a big plie, and jump in, because it feels like jumping into a soft, cozy bed. But having fun isn’t the only thing they do, they also grab a bunch of leaves and change their normal bedding into a much more cozy one.
                        Clover always loved cleaning, but when the leaf rain comes, she forgets about all her cleaning interests and jumps in with everyone else. She was the first hamster to wake up, when she was about to go outside and get an apple latte, the golden rain caught her eye. She gasped and wondered: “I felt like yesterday it was still spring, but now it’s fall?” She wasn’t the only one to be shocked though, when Sesame was about to go to “Hazelnut’s Coffee Corner” and try the “Nutty Blend” cake pop that has been so popular that he felt like he had to try it. When he went outside, he stood in awe as the leaves gently fluttered down like amber butterflies, he froze for a moment, then shouted: “IT’S FINALLY FALL!” This sound triggered everyone in the neighborhood to come enjoy this masterpiece of nature, and have fun in the endless piles of leaves.
                        Hazelnut got a lot of customers today because everyone wanted to try out the autumn specials and see how good they were. Mochi ordered a pumpkin cake pop, Lavender ordered a corn donut, and Rose and Clover ordered a bag of Halloween cookies each. When it was Ramen and Sesame’s turn, they simply invited Hazelnut to join the leafy fun, Hazelnut smiled: “Of course, shall we go after the others finish their food?” Sesame and Ramen replied: “Okay! And can you get us two of those Halloween lollies?” Hazelnut cheerfully agreed, and soon, Sesame and Ramen found themselves savoring ghost and pumpkin shaped lollipops with a classic caramel apple flavor, always the best. While Sesame and Ramen enjoyed their candy, the others had a great time too. Mochi said her cake pop was like heaven, the creaminess of the pumpkin almost melted into the cake, creating a perfect balance between flavors and texture, forming a symphony of flavors in Mochi’s mouth. Lavender knew she’d made the right choice the moment she bit into her donut, it had a slightly sticky texture from the corn and the flavor and creaminess was just unforgettable. Rose and Clover loved the cookies, they weren’t just your run-of-the-mill vanilla cookies, they had a warm tint that resembled the acorns and pecans, or maybe it was oats and sweet potato, and the frosting was a sweet cranberry flavor that made autumn truly special.
                        “Now that we’ve all finished eating our yummy treats, let’s go have some leafy fun!” Hazelnut pointed to the golden scene outside, the air still filled with colorful leaves fluttering around like colorful confetti dancing in the soft breeze.
                        The hamsters formed a circle and together, they ran towards the piles of leaves and jumped in at the same time, making the leaves fly into the crisp autumn air and flutter back down like colorful moths fluttering around and, eventually, falling back down and blending with the other leafs into a warm cozy, autumn scene inside the burrow. Sesame said: “Last time we made the biggest splash of water, so why not make the biggest splash of leaves this time!” Everyone thought this was an amazing idea so they quickly agreed. Soon, they were using the colorful brooms from Clover’s collection to sweep all the leaves into one big pile of leaves, not leaving a single leaf behind. In the end, the pile of leaves were bigger than all of the hamsters added up and the jump was just so satisfying. This time, it wasn't just merely a few leaves flying around, but every single leaf in the pile flown into the air, filling the whole burrow with it’s warm autumn hues. 
                        The leaves were then gathered up again for a fun game that Ramen suggested, he had wanted to have a leaf swimming contest. The giant pile of leaves were shaped into a rectangle and each hamster stood at the beginning of the rectangle. Hazelnut was the least athletic hamster out of all of them, so she offered to be the judge. The contest began and each one of the hamsters jumped into the pile and  began crawling in the leaves. Lavender and Clover, with their dancing skills, were at the head and Lavender was at first place, but then Clover caught up to her, Lavender didn’t want her chance of winning to be taken by somebody else, so she quickly sped up and was in front of Clover again. Just as they were almost tied, two speedy hamsters caught up on them from the middle, if you hadn’t taken a closer look, you wouldn’t have noticed that those two hamsters were Sesame and Ramen, they wanted to win together because they told Hazelnut the prize was a bag of sprinkles and they wanted to share it with each other. So they reached the end at the same time, and holding hands, they squeaked in victory as Hazelnut handed them the bag of sprinkles that represented their success. Sesame looked down at the others, and an idea popped out of him, he said to Ramen: “This is nice…but there's no way we’re finishing that many sprinkles, lets share it with the others!” Ramen loved the idea of this so he made a small speech: “So, um…I’ve had a little chat with Sesame and he thinks we should share these sprinkles together! So I’ll prepare a few bags and your sprinkles will be delivered mañana!” Sesame and Ramen giggled a bit, then Sesame explained: “Mañana means tomorrow in Spanish!” The other hamsters were filled with joy and excitement as Sesame and Ramen offered to share the sprinkles.
                        “Well, this rain is still going, so let’s celebrate it by making some treats at the cafe!” suggested Mochi, before Hazelnut could tell everyone about all the fun things they could make, Sesame and Ramen pleaded: “Hazelnut, can you show us how you made those lollies, how did you fill them with that caramel apple flavor!” Hazelnut loved the halloween lollipops as much as Sesame and Ramen did, so she was happy to make them with all the others, without more chit-chatting, all the hamsters followed Hazelnut to the cafe to make the yummy halloween lollipops that they all knew and loved. Hazelnut took everyone to the kitchen and said: “Making these lollies are simple! Just sugar, diced apples, water, some caramel sauce and bring it to a boil!” The hamsters gasped at the fact that the highly loved caramel apple lollipops are not made with some sort of complex potion, but simply a few ingredients boiled into a simple concoction. And soon, they found themselves adding ingredients into a pot and boiling them together. Then, with their candy mixture ready, they poured a few sprinkles into Hazelnut’s halloween lollipop molds and poured the candy mix in before putting it into the cooling chamber to set. About half an hour later, everyone were popping their favorite lollipops in and out of their mouths. But wait, something about it seemed…sweeter, maybe it was the feeling of making it themselves, or was it the feeling of being with each other, no one knows.
                        The rain of leaves stopped, and the hamsters waited for their sprinkles to be delivered, all of them filled with anticipation.
